<h1>P0325: Knock Sensor Circuit Malfunction</h1>
<h2>1. Technical Description</h2>
<p>A knock sensor tells the engine computer when one or more of your engine's cylinders are "knocking", that is, exploding the air/fuel mixture in a way that delivers less power and can be damaging to the engine if prolonged.</p>

<p>The computer uses this information to tune the engine so that it doesn't knock. If your knock sensor wasn't operating properly, so that it was always indicating a knock, the engine computer's response may have been to change the ignition timing on your engine. Knock sensors generally bolt into or thread into the engine block. This P0325 code may show up intermittently or the Service Engine light may be lit constantly. Other knock sensor related DTC codes include P0330.</p>

<h2>2. Symptoms</h2>
You may notice drivability problems including a lack of power and perhaps some hesitation. There may also be other symptoms.


<h2>3. Causes</h3>
A code P0325 may mean that one or more of the following has happened: 
<ul>
  <li>The knock sensor is faulty and needs to be replaced</li>
  <li>There is a wiring short/fault in the knock sensor circuit</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Possible Solutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check the resistance of the knock sensor (compare it to factory specs)</li>
  <li>Check for broken/frayed wires leading to the sensor</li>
  <li>Replace the knock sensor</li>
</ul>
